# Harvesting a Position
Harvesting a position in Orca Whirlpools allows you to collect any accumulated fees and rewards without closing the position. This process is useful when you want to claim your earnings while keeping your liquidity active in the pool, ensuring you continue to benefit from potential future fees.

## 1. Overview of Harvesting a Position
The SDK helps you generate the instructions needed to collect fees and rewards from a position without closing it. This allows you to realize your earnings while maintaining liquidity in the pool.

With this function, you can:
- Collect accumulated trading fees from your position.
- Harvest rewards earned by providing liquidity, all while keeping the position active.

## 2. Getting Started Guide
### Step-by-Step Guide to Harvesting a Position
To harvest fees and rewards from a position, follow these steps:
1. **RPC Client**: Use a Solana RPC client to interact with the blockchain.
2. **Position Mint**: Provide the mint address of the NFT representing your position. This NFT serves as proof of ownership and represents the liquidity in the position.
3. **Authority**: This can be your wallet, which will fund the pool initialization. If the authority is not specified, the default wallet will be used. You can configure the default wallet through the SDK.
4. **Create Instructions**: Use the appropriate function to generate the necessary instructions to harvest fees and rewards.

    ```tsx
    import { harvestPositionInstructions, setWhirlpoolsConfig } from '@orca-so/whirlpools';
    import { createSolanaRpc, devnet, address } from '@solana/kit';
    import { loadWallet } from './utils';

    await setWhirlpoolsConfig('solanaDevnet');
    const devnetRpc = createSolanaRpc(devnet('https://api.devnet.solana.com'));
    const wallet = await loadWallet();
    const positionMint = address("HqoV7Qv27REUtmd9UKSJGGmCRNx3531t33bDG1BUfo9K");

    const { feesQuote, rewardsQuote, instructions } = await harvestPositionInstructions(
      devnetRpc,
      positionMint,
      wallet
    );

    console.log(`Fees owed token A: ${feesQuote.feeOwedA}`);
    console.log(`Rewards '1' owed: ${rewardsQuote.rewards[0].rewardsOwed}`);
    ```

    ```rust
    use orca_whirlpools::{
        harvest_position_instructions, set_whirlpools_config_address, WhirlpoolsConfigInput,
    };
    use solana_client::nonblocking::rpc_client::RpcClient;
    use solana_sdk::pubkey::Pubkey;
    use std::str::FromStr;
    use crate::utils::load_wallet;

    #[tokio::main]
    async fn main() {
        set_whirlpools_config_address(WhirlpoolsConfigInput::SolanaDevnet).unwrap();
        let rpc = RpcClient::new("https://api.devnet.solana.com".to_string());
        let wallet = load_wallet();

        let position_mint_address =
            Pubkey::from_str("HqoV7Qv27REUtmd9UKSJGGmCRNx3531t33bDG1BUfo9K").unwrap();

        let result = harvest_position_instructions(&rpc, position_mint_address, Some(wallet.pubkey()))
            .await
            .unwrap();

        println!("Fees Quote: {:?}", result.fees_quote);
        println!("Rewards Quote: {:?}", result.rewards_quote);
        println!("Number of Instructions: {}", result.instructions.len());
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

5. **Submit Transaction**: Include the generated instructions in a Solana transaction and send it to the network using the Solana SDK.

## 3. Usage Example
Suppose you are a developer creating a bot to manage investments for a group of investors. The bot periodically collects accumulated fees and rewards from liquidity positions to distribute profits among investors. By using the SDK, you can generate the instructions to collect earnings from each active position without closing it, allowing the liquidity to continue generating returns and potentially reinvest your earned fees into the position.

## 4. Next Steps
After harvesting fees and rewards, you can:

- [Monitor Performance](02-Fetch%20Positions.mdx): Keep track of your position to evaluate future earnings and the overall performance.
- Reinvest Earnings: Use the harvested fees and rewards to add more liquidity or diversify your positions.
- Harvest Regularly: Regularly collect your earnings to maintain optimal capital efficiency while keeping your liquidity active.

By using the SDK, you can maximize the benefits of providing liquidity while keeping your position open and continuously earning fees.
