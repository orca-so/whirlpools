# Obtain SOL and Tokens

Let's obtain the SOL and tokens we will use in the tutorial.

You can obtain SOL on Devnet through airdrops, and you can mint your own tokens if you have SOL. However, for this tutorial, all of the tokens you need can be obtained from the site below.

## Visiting the site and connecting your wallet
Access the site and click on, "Connect Phantom".

The Phantom extension will open, and if this is the first time you have visited the site, you will need to click "Connect".

â€» When you do not have enough SOL repeat this step as needed.

## Obtaining Tokens
You can obtain 4 different types of tokens by exchanging 0.2 SOL for each type.

Click on each button in order starting from "Swap 0.2 SOL fro devUSDC" and ending with "Swap 0.2 SOL for devTMAC". Verify that the balances for the four token types are no longer 0.

You will be asked to approve a transaction for each swap of 0.2 SOL for tokens. Approve transactions as needed. It is possible you will see a message saying that the transaction may fail, but go ahead and try it.

Make sure the balances for SOL and each token are higher than indicated in the list below. As long as the balances are higher than listed, the exact numbers do not matter. If any balance is too low, please continue with the SOL airdrops and swaps.
- 1.0 SOL
- 10.0 devUSDC
- 10.0 devUSDT
- 1000.0 devSAMO
- 100.0 devTMAC
