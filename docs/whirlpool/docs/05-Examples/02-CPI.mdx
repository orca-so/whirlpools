# Cross-Program Invocation with Orca Whirlpools

This guide provides an overview of how to integrate the Orca Whirlpools Program into your own on-chain Anchor Programs using Cross-Program Invocation (CPI).

## Overview

The Orca CPI Examples repository offers a comprehensive toolkit for developers looking to integrate with Orca Whirlpools from their own Anchor programs. It includes examples for multiple Anchor versions and client-side implementations.

### Highlights

- CPI examples for multiple Anchor versions:
  - v0.29.0
  - v0.30.1
  - v0.31.0
- Client-side code for generating instruction data and account information using:
  - `@solana/web3.js`
  - `@solana/kit`
- Specific use case for Launchpad creators who want to graduate tokens from their bonding curve to Orca Whirlpools

## Program Implementation Considerations

### Solana CLI and Anchor Version Compatibility

Each Anchor version requires a specific Solana CLI version:

| Anchor Version | Solana CLI Version |
|----------------|-------------------|
| v0.29.0        | v1.18.17          |
| v0.30.1        | v1.18.17          |
| v0.31.0        | v2.1.0            |

### Important: Solana Program Dependency Patching

For Anchor versions 0.29.0 and 0.30.1, you **must patch** the `solana-program` crate:

- **Why?** These Anchor versions rely on `solana-program` crate < v2, while the Orca Whirlpools and Whirlpools SDK pull in `solana-program` > v2, creating version conflicts.
- **Solution:** Apply the patch using:
  ```bash
  cargo update solana-program@2.2.1 --precise 1.18.17
  ```

For Anchor version 0.31.0, **no patching is required** as it's compatible with `solana-program` > v2.

## Client Implementations

### Solana Kit Client

The `@solana/kit` client leverages modern Solana SDK features with:
- Automated Anchor client generation using Codama
- Integration with `@orca-so/whirlpools` SDK for Whirlpools interactions
- Test suite using `Bankrun` for simulation without a local validator

### Web3.js Client

The classic `@solana/web3.js` implementation with Anchor provides:
- Integration with Anchor for account management and instruction creation
- Compatibility with the Whirlpools SDK
- Testing framework using Vitest

### Important Note on Dependencies

The `@orca-so/whirlpools-sdk` is dependent on Anchor v0.29.0. For other Anchor versions, the examples include `resolutions` in the `package.json` to manage dependency conflicts.

## Specific Use Case: Launchpad Integration

For Launchpad creators who want to graduate tokens from their bonding curve to Orca Whirlpools, a detailed implementation guide is available at:

[Launchpad Integration Guide](https://github.com/orca-so/orca-cpi-examples/blob/main/use-cases/Launchpad.md)

This guide covers:
- How to configure and initialize Splash Pools (full-range CLMM pools)
- Managing token mint ordering and price calculation
- Position NFT ownership and fee collection opportunities
- Complete integration process from bonding curve to Orca Whirlpools

## Getting Started

To get started with CPI integration with Orca Whirlpools:

1. Clone the example repository
2. Select the appropriate Anchor version for your project
3. Follow the setup instructions in the README
4. Explore the specific use cases in the repository

The repository includes a `run-tests.sh` script that automates all the setup and testing steps, making it easy to get started with CPI integration.
