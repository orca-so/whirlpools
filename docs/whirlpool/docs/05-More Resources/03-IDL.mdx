# IDL
An Interface Description Language (IDL) file provides a standardized JSON file describing the program's instructions and accounts. This file simplifies the process of integrating your on-chain program with client applications.

To interact with the program, we highly recommend using our SDKs. For low-level control, use [`@orca-so/whirlpools_client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@orca-so/whirlpools-client) for TypeScript or [`orca_whirlpools_client`](https://crates.io/crates/orca_whirlpools_client) for Rust. Both are generated using Codama based on the IDL of the Whirlpool Program.

If you're using a different programming language, or simply want to inspect our IDL you can download it by clicking on the link below.
