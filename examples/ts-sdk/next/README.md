# Whirlpools Next.js Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Whirlpools SDK in a Next.js application. Since the Orca SDK suite uses WebAssembly, the `experiments.asyncWebAssembly` feature of webpack must be enabled and `@orca-so/whirlpools-core` needs to be added as a `serverExternalPackages`. See `next.config.js` for more details.
