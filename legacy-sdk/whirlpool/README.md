# Legacy Whirlpools SDK

Whirpools is an open-source concentrated liquidity AMM contract on the Solana blockchain.

The legacy Whirlpools Typescript SDK (`@orca-so/whirlpools-sdk`) allows for easy interaction with a deployed Whirlpools program and is a solid choice if you are working the Solana Web3.js \<v2.

The contract has been audited by Kudelski and Neodyme.
