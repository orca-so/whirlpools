## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [#944](https://github.com/orca-so/whirlpools/pull/944) [`6d601bb`](https://github.com/orca-so/whirlpools/commit/6d601bb4689e5c8e67086eb6e792d6c12e41fab1) Thanks [@jshiohaha](https://github.com/jshiohaha)! - Add instruction with max compute unit limit for simulation if none are provided

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#929](https://github.com/orca-so/whirlpools/pull/929) [`62ba4ca`](https://github.com/orca-so/whirlpools/commit/62ba4ca4e1eba67898865b2c1ccc78af6e1f860a) Thanks [@jshiohaha](https://github.com/jshiohaha)! - BREAKING: Changed build_transaction to accept the transaction payer instead of a list of signers because the caller might not have access to all signers when building a transaction. Under the hood, we rely on the `num_required_signers` in a compiled message to determine how many signatures to include when creating a VersionedTransaction

Fixed transaction signature mismatch in compute unit estimation that caused "accounts offsets" errors.
